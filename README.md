# RNAseqEnsemble

RNAseqEnsemble is an analytical framework collecting a few popular RNAseq analysis methods like DESeq, baySeq cuffdiff TSPM edgeR. 

## Requirements
RNAseqEnsemble was developed using Python 2.7.13. In addition to requirements specified in setup.py, RNAseqEnsemble requires installation of the following tools:

* [Bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)
* [GATK, version 3.7-0](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/)
* [picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/)
* [samtools](http://www.htslib.org/download/)

## Installation
Proper function of RNAseqEnsemble requires the paths to depencies to be set.  To do this, manually set the paths in `paths.cfg` using a text editor.

After the correct paths have been set, install RNAseqEnsemble with the following command:
```
python setup.py install
```

## Usage
All of RNAseqEnsembles functions may be accessed using its command line interface. General usage is as follows:
```
RNAseqEnsemble COMMAND [OPTIONS] [ARGS]...
